We use retrospective SHARELIFE data to analyse women&#39;s work history from 1950 to 1990. We provide descriptive evidence that women&#39;s work experience varied across CEECs. Furthermore, we argue that comparing the former provinces of the Russian Empire in Lithuania and Poland provides a natural experiment, allowing us to disentangle the effect of the differential implementation of the Soviet regime from the pre-existing differences. We find that during communism, Lithuanian women worked 2 years more by age 50 relative to their Polish counterparts. This effect is one-third of that found in the East-West Germany comparison. We propose several potential mechanisms behind this finding: the degree of land collectivization, the Church&#39;s influence and the sectoral composition. Accordingly, this study&#39;s findings highlight the importance of country differences in CEECs.</p>

                <p class="text-justify px-3 py-1z m-0">Many economic and causal parameters of interest depend on generated regressors. Examples include structural parameters in models with endogenous variables estimated by control functions and in models with sample selection, treatment effect estimation with propensity score matching, and marginal treatment effects. Inference with generated regressors is complicated by the very complex expression for influence functions and asymptotic variances. To address this problem, we propose Automatic Locally Robust/debiased GMM estimators in a general setting with generated regressors. Importantly, we allow for the generated regressors to be generated from machine learners, such as Random Forest, Neural Nets, Boosting, and many others. We use our results to construct novel Doubly Robust and Locally Robust estimators for the Counterfactual Average Structural Function and Average Partial Effects in models with endogeneity and sample selection, respectively. We provide sufficient conditions for the asymptotic normality of our debiased GMM estimators and investigate their finite sample performance through Monte Carlo simulations.</p>

In the binary choice model, the CASF measures the rate of successes in a counterfactual scenario. This paper shows that the CASF is non-parametrically identified as a weighted average, where the weights are given by a likelihood ratio. Estimation of the CASF at the regular root n-rate requires a square integrability condition for those weights. This necessary condition depends on instrument strength, the degree of endogeneity, and the relevance of the regressors. Much insight is gained from the single normal regressor model. In this setting, I show that extrapolation strength (the capacity of the model to regularly identify the CASF) increases with the relevance of the regressor and, surprisingly, with the degree of endogeneity. The impact of instrument strength is found to be non-monotone. Moreover, I find a threshold for instrument strength below which regular identification of the CASF is not possible.</p>
